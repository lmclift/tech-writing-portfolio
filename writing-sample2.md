# Sample 2: Desk Level Procedure
## Summary
The customer needed a document that outlined how a call center agent should resolve and document a call from a member seeking insurance coverage for emergency care. To develop this desk level procedure, I met with and interviewed the subject matter experts who were responsible for developing the process. I drafted the document based on their input. The end result of the project was that call center agents were able to correctly document and process verbal authorizations for members over the phone.
## Out of Network Emergency Benefits
### Overview
The purpose of this DLP is to document the verbal authorization process for approving coverage for emergency benefits when there are no in-network specialists within a 35-mile radius of the member.
### Procedure
A verbal pre-authorization must be provided when the member needs to use an out-of-network provider when there are no specialists within a 35-mile radius. Follow the steps below to document a verbal authorization:
1. Present the available options to the member and encourage them to select an office with you on the phone.
2. If the member does not choose an office on the phone, they must call back before going into the appointment. 
**Note:** A verbal authorization must be created before the memberâ€™s appointment. The member must know the name of the treating dentist they will be seeing.
3. Complete the Call Form:
    1. **Contact Tab:** Set the subject as Emergency Pre-Auth.
    2. **Details Tab:** Complete the tab as you would a regular call.	
    3. **Remarks Tab:** Enter the treating dentist name and office address.
    4. **Authorize code 1234 for specialty.** No dollar amount is required. It will look like the following:
    | Procedure Code | 1234 |
    | --- | --- |
    | Tooth: | N/A |
    | Copay: | N/A |
    | Fee: | N/A |
    5. **Resolution Tab:** Check the box beside **Complete Call Form**.
4. Route the Call Form to the appropriate work queue.

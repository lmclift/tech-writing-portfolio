# Sample 3: School Board Policy
## Summary
**Business Requirements:** The school district needed a policy outlining the rules and expectations regarding the establishment and operation of booster organizations.

**Target Audience:** This document was developed to be used by the districtâ€™s school board, Superintendent, and school administration.

**Writing Process:** Since there are currently no regulations at the state or federal level relating to this type of school-affiliated organization, this policy was developed by primarily working with individuals from the district to determine their needs. The end result was that the district had a document to clearly communicate expectations for the governance of this type of organization.

## School Booster Organizations
### Purpose

The purpose of booster organizations is to support and enhance but not to direct or replace activities of the district athletic program. The School Board recognizes and appreciates the cooperation, encouragement and support given by booster organizations to various extracurricular activities operating in its schools. However, it is necessary that all district-operated activities remain at the school level and under the control, direction and supervision of the Board through its professional employees.

### Authority

It is the responsibility of the Superintendent and the Board to annually recognize school-related organizations and to approve their activities.
Booster organizations do not have the authority to direct the duties of a district employee. The schedule of contests, rules for participation, methods for earning letters and all other criteria dealing with inter-school programs are under the jurisdiction of the local school administration.

### Guidelines

Being the elected and responsible body for directing all educational and extracurricular programs and activities, the Board sets forth the following policy guidelines to maintain its legal and ethical responsibilities in relation to booster groups:

1. To facilitate communications between the booster clubs and the district, and to make clear to all concerned the purposes of the booster organizations, the Board requires from each group a list of current officers, their telephone numbers and addresses, and a current statement of by-laws and objectives of the group. These documents must be submitted to the Activities Director or to the Athletic Director and to the principal by July 1st of the current school year or three (3) weeks prior to the start of the extracurricular season. Lists of officers are to be submitted annually. Objectives and by-laws should only be submitted when changed or amended.
2. When using any school facility for meetings, fundraisers, socials, banquets and other activities, booster organizations must complete the "Facility Use" form and submit it to the Activities Director. Approval must be received prior to the event.
3. Any equipment or uniforms that are purchased by a booster club must be approved by the Athletic Director and the principal in advance. Such purchases shall become the property of the district.
4. The Board requires that activities and programs sponsored by booster groups not be in violation of Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA) rules or other regulatory standards.
5. The Board does not assume any financial responsibility for a booster group and excludes itself from any liability a booster group may incur.
6. Booster groups shall not use the district tax exemption number for purchases. Groups should consider filing with the Commission on Charitable Organizations, Department of State, as a charitable non-profit organization.
7. Booster clubs should ensure that all proper licenses have been procured for proposed fundraising and activities. Proper documentation to this effect must be on file.
8. Requests for fundraising activities shall be directed, in writing, to the Activities Director and approved by the principal or designee. Fundraising activities shall conform to existing district guidelines. No student time during the school day shall be allowed for fundraising activities for any booster organization.
9. A booster organization planning a recognition event shall request permission of the Athletic Director and the building principal to conduct such an event and shall clear the date of the event with the Athletic Director and the building principal.
